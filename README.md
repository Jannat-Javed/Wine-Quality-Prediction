### Wine Quality Prediction

The Wine Quality Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. By analyzing a dataset containing features such as acidity, sugar levels, pH, and alcohol content, the model aims to accurately classify wine quality on a scale. The project involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to ensure the highest predictive accuracy. This tool is particularly useful for wine producers and consumers looking to assess wine quality objectively. The final model can serve as a reliable predictor in various wine production scenarios.
